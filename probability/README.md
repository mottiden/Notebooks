probability
===========

A series of ipython notebooks developed while following the MIT Open Courseware class [Probability Systems Analysis 
and Applied Probability](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-041-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2010/index.htm). 

The mathematics notes are mostly taken from 

[1] D.P. Bertsekas and J.N. Tsitsiklis, "Introduction to Probability", Aethena Scientific, 2008

The python sample code is independently developed. There are many examples of using [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/).
