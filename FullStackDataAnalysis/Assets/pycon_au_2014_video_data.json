At Heroku, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad armed with large amounts of data and spare CPU cycles. These are their stories.\"\nBad behavior can wreak havoc on your web application. It might be mass-signups, fraudulent orders, spammy posts, right up to automated bots designed to work around restrictions you have set in place; this can cost you time, resources, and lots of money. All is not lost though. Despite the ongoing efforts of abusers, their activity still leaves fingerprints and clues, which you can use to your advantage.\nThis talk is a 101 introduction to some of the methods which you can use to separate good from bad users using a combination of data mining, statistics, and some some basic machine learning. Basically, I want to get you thinking like an internet detective.\nSome of the topics I will be covering include:\nAs this is a 101 topic I will provide some basic examples, as well as links to more in-depth resources for further reading. I would recommend this talk to developers of web applications, especially those with a large number of users, the ability to process credit cards, or with a 'free' offering.

And, if our brains haven't exploded yet, we might throw in some asynchronous cached-view-generation  just for good measure.\nWhether you're a hobbyist or a grizzled veteran, you should come out of this talk with a few new tricks up your sleeve for making all your sites do more with less work.\nExpect references from -- depending on mood -- Alice in Wonderland, The Matrix, or Dante Alighieri's \"Inferno\".", "Youtube dislikes": 0}, {"Recorded": "Aug. 11, 2014", "Youtube views": 86, "Download": "ogg", "Youtube likes": 0, "Video origin": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxKf7LGf7x8", "Category": "PyCon AU 2014", "Tags": "No tags", "Speakers": "Juan Nunez-Iglesias", "Copyright/License Information": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "Metadata": "JSON", "Language": "English", "Last updated": "Aug. 14, 2014", "Description": null, "Youtube dislikes": 1}, {"Recorded": "Aug. 11, 2014", "Youtube views": 98, "Download": "ogg", "Youtube likes": 0, "Video origin": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_q5BaniZH0", "Category": "PyCon AU 2014", "Tags": "No tags", "Speakers": "Joshua Hesketh", "Copyright/License Information": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "Metadata": "JSON", "Language": "English", "Last updated": "Aug. 14, 2014", "Description": "This is a talk about how OpenStack does database migration continuous integration, and how other projects might be able to learn from what we've done.\nOpenStack is an interesting project in that it runs in a variety of different scale scenarios. There are very small deployments of only a few machines, and large public clouds with thousands of machines. The OpenStack project takes Continuous Integration (CI) very seriously, and runs a suite of unit and integration tests on all proposed patches.\nOne thing we weren't very good at testing though, was database upgrades. We have unit tests for many of them, but we don't know how these upgrades affect real users in the field. As a response, we worked on adding database migration testing to our CI environment. This new test infrastructure is open source (https://github.com/stackforge/turbo-hipster), and extensible. It currently runs tests on smaller databases, as well as a largish real user database. It has already caught two significant performance problems in database migrations.\nThis talk will cover how we built the test infrastructure (in python!).

Information from log messages and details of any Python exceptions which occurred, along with other application performance data can help to identify the issue, but not always. Often you will need to fall back to a development or test environment and hope you can replicate the problem and then debug the issue from there.\nThe purpose of this talk is to dive in and look at one class of tools that can be used in helping debug web applications. Specifically, it will look at web application tools such as the Django debug tool bar.\nRather than simply look at how you might use such a tool though, this talk will look at how these debug tool bars are actually implemented, how they hook into your web application, how they capture the information that they do, as well as how they can be extended to add new functionality.\nThe limitations on these tools as far as performance overhead, security of data etc, which nearly aways lead to them only being recommended for development environments, will also be discussed.\nAt the same time though, this notion that they are only suitable for development environments will also be challenged by looking at how a tool such as the New Relic Python agent, which implements application performance monitoring, overcomes such limitations to provide a production grade solution.\nAre there lessons to be learnt from how the New Relic Python agent works which could drive improvements to existing web application debug tool bars? Could the New Relic Python agent itself be used as a base for a new generation of debug tool bars which combine an ability to debug a web application, even in a production environment, with the ability to monitor the performance of the web application over time?", "Youtube dislikes": 1}, {"Recorded": "Aug. 11, 2014", "Youtube views": 90, "Download": "ogg", "Youtube likes": 2, "Video origin": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxWHXQ-G7cc", "Category": "PyCon AU 2014", "Tags": "No tags", "Speakers": "Paul Leopardi", "Copyright/License Information": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "Metadata": "JSON", "Language": "English", "Last updated": "Aug. 14, 2014", "Description": null, "Youtube dislikes": 0}, {"Recorded": "Aug. 11, 2014", "Youtube views": 102, "Download": "ogg", "Youtube likes": 2, "Video origin": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8Jui4EQbB8", "Category": "PyCon AU 2014", "Tags": "No tags", "Speakers": "Jakub Krajcovic", "Copyright/License Information": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "Metadata": "JSON", "Language": "English", "Last updated": "Aug. 14, 2014", "Description": null, "Youtube dislikes": 0}, {"Recorded": "Aug. 11, 2014", "Youtube views": 73, "Download": "ogg", "Youtube likes": 2, "Video origin": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMHom03oZ_Y", "Category": "PyCon AU 2014", "Tags": "No tags", "Speakers": "Angus Salkeld", "Copyright/License Information": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "Metadata": "JSON", "Language": "English", "Last updated": "Aug. 14, 2014", "Description": null, "Youtube dislikes": 0}, {"Recorded": "Aug. 11, 2014", "Youtube views": 44, "Download": "ogg", "Youtube likes": 0, "Video origin": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YTz3qUBxSk", "Category": "PyCon AU 2014", "Tags": "No tags", "Speakers": "Joseph Gordon", "Copyright/License Information": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "Metadata": "JSON", "Language": "English", "Last updated": "Aug. 14, 2014", "Description": null, "Youtube dislikes": 0}, {"Recorded": "Aug. 11, 2014", "Youtube views": 62, "Download": "ogg", "Youtube likes": 0, "Video origin": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcwLcKhbVSk", "Category": "PyCon AU 2014", "Tags": "No tags", "Speakers": "Robert Collins", "Copyright/License Information": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "Metadata": "JSON", "Language": "English", "Last updated": "Aug. 14, 2014", "Description": "", "Youtube dislikes": 0}, {"Recorded": "Aug. 11, 2014", "Youtube views": 82, "Download": "ogg", "Youtube likes": 0, "Video origin": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrXup6wr7EQ", "Category": "PyCon AU 2014", "Tags": "No tags", "Speakers": "Grant Murphy", "Copyright/License Information": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "Metadata": "JSON", "Language": "English", "Last updated": "Aug. 14, 2014", "Description": null, "Youtube dislikes": 0}, {"Recorded": "Aug. 11, 2014", "Youtube views": 443, "Download": "ogg", "Youtube likes": 2, "Video origin": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QOMk2k9aI8", "Category": "PyCon AU 2014", "Tags": "No tags", "Speakers": "Lex Hider", "Copyright/License Information": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "Metadata": "JSON", "Language": "English", "Last updated": "Aug. 14, 2014", "Description": null, "Youtube dislikes": 0}, {"Recorded": "Aug. 11, 2014", "Youtube views": 85, "Download": "ogg", "Youtube likes": 0, "Video origin": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fSOMF2KG9Y4", "Category": "PyCon AU 2014", "Tags": "No tags", "Speakers": "Jay Larson", "Copyright/License Information": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "Metadata": "JSON", "Language": "English", "Last updated": "Aug. 14, 2014", "Description": null, "Youtube dislikes": 1}, {"Recorded": "Aug. 11, 2014", "Youtube views": 165, "Download": "ogg", "Youtube likes": 2, "Video origin": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcMaO2f7ww4", "Category": "PyCon AU 2014", "Tags": "No tags", "Speakers": "Arthur Street", "Copyright/License Information": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "Metadata": "JSON", "Language": "English", "Last updated": "Aug. 14, 2014", "Description": "Pandas is increasingly becoming a standard tool in scientific computing.  Could it also have a role in the CFO's office?\nCFOs regularly need to analyse the impact of different projects or business cases, and they almost universally do this using spreadsheets.  Spreadsheets have many advantages - they have a low barrier to entry and are easy for most people to understand.  However as they get more complicated, disadvantages start to appear; in particular, they can be inflexible and highly error-prone.\nIn this talk I will explain how business case analysis can be done using python and pandas.  The python version has several advantages over spreadsheets: it is more flexible as the business structure changes; formulas only need to be changed in a single place, reducing the chance of error; and report-ready plots are quick to produce.  I'll go through a way of structuring the problem for some simple business logic, and ways to visualise the results.\nThe example I\u2019ll discuss is made more interesting and useful by being \u201cMonte Carlo\u201d analysis. Traditional business case analysis takes single point estimates of sales, costs and prices, and calculates a single profit forecast. Everybody knows the profit will not turn out to be exactly equal to the forecast.  But it is not clear what the range of profits might be, or how likely a loss is.  \"Monte Carlo\" analysis solves this problem by allowing ranges or distributions on the assumptions; the forecast is then a range of outcomes.\nIn short, I\u2019ll demonstrate how you can use pandas to analyse high-impact business decisions, and dodge many of the problems of using spreadsheets.", "Youtube dislikes": 0}, {"Recorded": "Aug. 11, 2014", "Youtube views": 174, "Download": "ogg", "Youtube likes": 1, "Video origin": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKcRcdu9X3Y", "Category": "PyCon AU 2014", "Tags": "No tags", "Speakers": "Clare Sloggett", "Copyright/License Information": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "Metadata": "JSON", "Language": "English", "Last updated": "Aug. 14, 2014", "Description": null, "Youtube dislikes": 0}, {"Recorded": "Aug. 11, 2014", "Youtube views": 74, "Download": "ogg", "Youtube likes": 0, "Video origin": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scgudhbfmjA", "Category": "PyCon AU 2014", "Tags": "No tags", "Speakers": "Justin Clacherty", "Copyright/License Information": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "Metadata": "JSON", "Language": "English", "Last updated": "Aug. 14, 2014", "Description": null, "Youtube dislikes": 0}, {"Recorded": "Aug. 11, 2014", "Youtube views": 18, "Download": "ogg", "Youtube likes": 0, "Video origin": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyjSa4Gqxjo", "Category": "PyCon AU 2014", "Tags": "No tags", "Speakers": "Ed Schofield", "Copyright/License Information": "http://www.youtube.com/t/terms", "Metadata": "JSON", "Language": "English", "Last updated": "Aug. 14, 2014", "Description": "Welcome to the Science and Data miniconf.

Supported by the Mozilla Science Lab, it runs two-day bootcamps all over the world, provides open access material for self-paced instruction, and runs a training program for aspiring instructors. The core two-day curriculum includes the Unix shell (and how to automate repetitive tasks); Python or R (and how to grow a program in a modular, testable way); Git and GitHub (and how to track and share work efficiently); and SQL (and the difference between structured and unstructured data).     \nWhile the organisation has been around for over a decade, it had a breakout year in 2013. The number of qualified instructors swelled to over 100 and collectively they ran over 100 events for over 4300 researchers in a dozen countries. To kick things off in Australia, the founder of Software Carpentry (Dr. Greg Wilson) visited Sydney and Melbourne in February 2013 to host the first ever bootcamps outside of Europe and North America. Since that visit five local instructors have been trained up and have delivered an additional ten bootcamps around the country.\nThis presentation will review the first year of Software Carpentry activities in Australia, with a particular focus on the key lessons learned in teaching computational best practices to the research community. Future plans and directions will also be outlined, including an overview of an innovative new project called the Research Bazaar. Coordinated out of The University of Melbourne, this project has started offering regular bootcamps to researchers in the Melbourne area and looks set to inspire widespread institutional support for bootcamp delivery. The Software Carpentry teaching materials are also undergoing rapid development, with work on an advanced curriculum and new lessons on \u201cdata carpentry\u201d already underway.

This presentation will offer an easy introduction to the world of networks and graphs in Python and will illustrate real world uses of this powerful and useful paradigm.", "Youtube dislikes": 1}, {"Recorded": "Aug. 9, 2014", "Youtube views": 403, "Download": "ogg", "Youtube likes": 3, "Video origin": "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf8DXDEWnaw", "Category": "PyCon AU 2014", "Tags": "No tags", "Speakers": "Jackson Gatenby", "Copyright/License Information": "http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/", "Metadata": "JSON", "Language": "English", "Last updated": "Aug. 14, 2014", "Description": "There are a lot of hurdles to overcome when learning your first programming language - What does this error mean?

Using these data structures can lead to simpler, more robust code.\nAs well as explaining how to use some of the data structures that we encounter, we\u2019ll also be checking through open source code to see how they are used in the real world.

If you've ever predicted anything, or tried to work out whether some number was \"good enough\", you'll probably get something out of this presentation. All techniques and tools demonstrated using Python.\nEvery day, decisions both big and small are made on the basis of the information published by the Bureau of Meteorology. These include simple decisions such as taking an umbrella or planning a barbecue. Our forecasts also inform Australia's emergency services on where extreme weather events may have occurred, to help with planning and preparation.\nUnderstanding and communicating our strengths and weaknesses is very important, both as an organisation and also internally within the Environment and Research division. This presentation will focus on the statistical methods and systems used to evaluate the objective, scientific performance of our forecast systems. The name for this area of study is \"Verification\". While the concepts have come from the research environment, they are widely applicable and can help anyone who is assessing the performance of any system.\nThis presentation will include:\n  -- An overview of the major ideas of verification\n  -- How to create a 'skill score'\n  -- The application of these concepts to thunderstorm forecasting\n  -- How to use Python tools for verification analyses\n  -- Tips on how to apply these ideas easily in other contexts\nObtaining relevant thunderstorm observational data can be particularly challenging, particularly pertaining to severe and damaging aspects: lightning, hail, heavy rain and very strong wind gusts. In order achieve a stronger footing, some new methods of analysis are under development. It is necessary to establish the scientific validity of the verification metrics at the same time as constructing the systems to support the data analysis.\nA prototype web-based tool written in Python (and under active development by the presenter) will be demonstrated. This tool can run locally to provide an enhanced lab environment for assessing case study data, or be set up as a server for continuous monitoring and reporting.\nNo pre-existing knowledge of Python or statistics is assumed.
